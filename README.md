Just walked out. Cleaner. Oh wow,   was... like a rollercoaster ride in the dark with unexpected sharp turns. My back is still crammed from those sticky theater seats, they’re better suited for. . . garden gnomes maybe. Picture popcorn crumbs skating all over my jeans on their own tiny adventures.

then I got thinking, like sitting my wheelbarrow when I'm plotting out a new client's lawn — unpredictable yet satisfyingly structured. Ugh, why was there no air conditioning, or like a breeze or somRTitbuRe, randomly spread through the plot.

Sorry not sorry. Here:
